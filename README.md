# license-plate-detection
This project uses OpenCV and PyTesseract to recognize license plate numbers from car images. The process involves preprocessing the image, extracting and grouping license plate contours, rotating and cropping the license plate image, and using PyTesseract for OCR. The longest recognized license plate number is then printed as output.
